    "# Arithmetic Expressions in Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "This section provides examples of arithmetic expressions commonly used in programming and data science. We'll cover basic operations, order of operations, and some common pitfalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the fundamental arithmetic operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Addition:** `+` (e.g., `5 + 3` results in `8`)\n",
    "*   **Subtraction:** `-` (e.g., `10 - 4` results in `6`)\n",
    "*   **Multiplication:** `*` (e.g., `6 * 7` results in `42`)\n",
    "*   **Division:** `/` (e.g., `15 / 3` results in `5.0` - note the floating-point result in many languages)\n",
    "*   **Integer Division (Floor Division):** `//` (e.g., `15 // 3` results in `5`, `16 // 3` results in `5` - discards the remainder)\n",
    "*   **Modulo (Remainder):** `%` (e.g., `17 % 5` results in `2` - the remainder after division)\n",
    "*   **Exponentiation:** `**` (e.g., `2 ** 3` results in `8` - 2 raised to the power of 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Order of Operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions are evaluated according to a specific order of operations, often remembered by the acronyms PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction) or BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Parentheses/Brackets:** Operations within parentheses are evaluated first.\n",
    "2.  **Exponents/Orders:** Exponentiation is evaluated next.\n",
    "3.  **Multiplication and Division:** These are evaluated from left to right.\n",
    "4.  **Addition and Subtraction:** These are evaluated from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `2 + 3 * 4` results in `14` (multiplication is performed before addition).\n",
    "*   `(2 + 3) * 4` results in `20` (parentheses force addition to be performed first).\n",
    "*   `10 / 2 + 3` results in `8.0` (division is performed before addition).\n",
    "*   `10 / (2 + 3)` results in `2.0` (parentheses force addition to be performed first).\n",
    "*   `2 ** 3 + 1` results in `9` (exponentiation is performed before addition).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples in Code (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples implemented in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 3\n",
    "print(a + b)      # Output: 8\n",

    "*   **Achievable:** They should be realistic and attainable within the context of the material.\n",
    "*   **Relevant:** They should be relevant to the overall goals and purpose of the material.\n",
    "*   **Time-bound (Optional):** Sometimes it's helpful to include a timeframe, especially in structured learning environments (e.g., \"within one hour\").\n",
    "\n",
    "A helpful framework for writing objectives is the ABCD framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Audience:** Who is the target learner? (Often implied)\n",
    "*   **Behavior:** What should the learner be able to *do*? (Use action verbs)\n",
    "*   **Condition:** Under what circumstances or constraints should the learner be able to perform the behavior?\n",
    "*   **Degree:** To what extent or level of proficiency should the learner be able to perform the behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of well-written objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Example 1 (Data Analysis):**\n",
    "    *   **Poor:** Understand data cleaning techniques.\n",
    "    *   **Better:** Given a messy dataset in CSV format, the learner will be able to use Pandas to identify and handle missing values, duplicate rows, and inconsistent data entries with 90% accuracy.\n",
    "*   **Example 2 (Machine Learning):**\n",
    "    *   **Poor:** Learn about linear regression.\n",
    "    *   **Better:** The learner will be able to implement linear regression using Scikit-learn in Python and evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R-squared.\n",
    "*   **Example 3 (Programming):**\n",
    "    *   **Poor:** Learn about Python functions.\n",
    "    *   **Better:** Given a problem description, the learner will be able to write a Python function with appropriate input parameters and a return value to solve the problem.\n",
    "*   **Example 4 (Data Visualization):**\n",
    "    *   **Poor:** Understand data visualization principles.\n",
    "    *   **Better:** Using Matplotlib or Seaborn, the learner will be able to create appropriate visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs) to effectively communicate insights from a given dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Objectives in Your Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Jupyter Notebook, you can use this section to clearly state the objectives of the notebook at the beginning. This helps the reader understand what they should expect to gain from working through the material.\n",
